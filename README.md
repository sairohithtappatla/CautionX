1. **URL Input**: Enter a URL for analysis.
2. **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines VirusTotal API and custom heuristic scoring:
   - Keywords like "login," "secure," "password" increase the score.
   - Entropy analysis detects unusual or suspicious patterns.
3. **Real-Time Results**: Display safety scores and detailed breakdowns instantly.
